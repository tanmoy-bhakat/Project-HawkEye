This project, “Laser Alert System using ESP32,” is a simple yet effective security system designed to detect any interruption in a laser beam. When the laser light on the LDR is blocked, the system immediately activates a buzzer alarm and sends a real-time alert message to the user’s phone via Telegram Bot.
